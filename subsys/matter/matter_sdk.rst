##########

This chapter introduces Matter SDK and how to take it into use.
See the [Introduce to Matter SDK project](https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip-doc/index.html) documentation about Matter SDK Open source project and [Open Thread Border Router](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router) documentations.

Requirements
************

1. 1-2 Balletto DK for Matter devices.
#. nRF8240 USB Dongle for Thread Border router with Network RPC Co-Processor binary
#. Ubuntu 22.04 PC for acting as a Border router

Getting started
***************

Alif Matter SDK is using Zephyr platform setup with OpenThread. So initial setup for Zephyr environment is needed.
This chapter defines how to set up Matter environment for Linux Ubuntu 22.04 based operating system and how to config Thread border router for Matter.

Prerequites for Ubuntu 22.04
============================

Install dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev \
        libglib2.0-dev libavahi-client-dev ninja-build python3-venv python3-dev \
        python3-pip unzip libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev libreadline-dev


Matter SDK helper scripts
=========================

Alif SDK has helper scripts to create a Matter build environment and building it.
These scripts need to be called from the Alif SDK root folder.

.. code-block::

    scripts/matter
    ├── activate_env.sh
    └── matter_env_setup.sh


Matter subsystem
================

Matter subsystem is a glue layer between a Matter open source project and a Zephyr application.
It defines an API for initializing Matter stack and its main features.

Create Python virtual env and install Matter tools
==================================================

Matter open source project provides a script that creates an own Python virtual environment and installs ZAP tools.

1. The script calls Matter bootstrap script
#. Installs all necessary Python packets
#. Builds Matter SDK Host tools
#. Adds the tools to PATH with following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    source scripts/matter/matter_env_setup.sh


After running this installation script, Matter SDK build system is ready for compiling the samples.

Before building Matter ZAP or Chip-Tool, Matter virtual environment must be activated with following command:

.. code-block:: console

    source scripts/matter/activate_env.sh


If the activate script says the environment is out of date, you can update it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    source scripts/matter/matter_env_setup.sh


Deactivate Matter build environment with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    deactivate


Thread Border router setup
==========================

This guide covers building and configuration of Open Thread Border router (OTBR) with nRF52840 USB Dongle with Open Thread Co-Processor application.

Configure and build
===================

Clone the OTBR repository and install default setup:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix
    cd ot-br-posix
    ./script/bootstrap


Compile and install by using Ethernet interface:

.. code-block:: console

    INFRA_IF_NAME=eth0 ./script/setup

**NOTE** Ethernet interface may be something else than eth0 on your system so adjust it accordingly

Configure RCP device
--------------------

Create a custom udev rule file to identify the nRF52840 dongle based on it's vendor- and product-id.

Attach the flashed RCP device to the Border Router platform via USB and check device serial number by using command:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo dmesg


Edit a ``/etc/udev/rules.d/99-acm.rules`` and add following line with your dongle's information

.. code-block:: console

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1915", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", ATTRS{serial}=="YOUR_DONGLES_SERIAL_HERE", SYMLINK+="ttyOTBR"


Check that the device is found with the given name by the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    ls /dev/tty*

You should see ``/dev/ttyOTBR``.

To configure the RCP device's serial port in otbr-agent settings:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo nano /etc/default/otbr-agent

Edit ``OTBR_AGENT_OPTS`` line by following way for device ``/dev/ttyOTBR`` and ``eth0``:

.. code-block:: console

    OTBR_AGENT_OPTS="-I wpan0 -B eth0 spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyOTBR trel://eth0"

Next, power cycle the dongle to activate the border router and create a ``wpan0``.

Light switch sample
*******************

This sample demonstrates a device acting as a light switch which controls a light bulb
Build sample with following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    cd samples/matter/light-switch \
    west build -b alif_b1_fpga_rtss_he_ble


Light bulb sample
*****************

This sample demonstrates a device acting as a light bulb and how to bind it to a light switch or used direct by ``chip-tool`` controller.
Build sample with following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    cd samples/matter/light-bulb \
    west build -b alif_b1_fpga_rtss_he_ble


Commission device to Thread network over BLE
********************************************

After flashing the sample device will activate default private thread network named as ``ot_zephyr``. The device will also activate BLE advertisement for commissioning over BLE.
Thread and Matter commissioning is handled by Matter SDK's ``chip-tool`` which is build and added to ``PATH``.

Commissioning requirements
==========================
``chip-tool`` commissioning over BLE to Thread network command API:

.. code-block:: console

    $ chip-tool pairing ble-thread <node_id> hex:<operational_dataset> <pin_code> <discriminator>


Before start process we need to know the following parameters:

* ``node_id``: Device Node identfier given by user
* ``operational_dataset``: Thread Border router active Dataset
* ``pin_code``: Device BLE Setup Pincode, Default: ``20202021``
* ``discriminator``: Device 12-bit Discriminator, Default: ``3840`` in hex: ``0xf00``

How to get Thread border router active dataset
==============================================

Border router active data is checked by following command:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ot-ctl dataset active -x
    35060004001fffe00c0402a0f7f8051000112233445566778899aabbccddee00030e4f70656e54687265616444656d6f0410445f2b5ca6f2a93a55ce570a70efeecb000300001a02081111111122222222010212340708fd110022000000000e0800000003601c0000
    Done


How to get Device information:
==============================

Matter shell has a command `matter config` to print active configuration.
Here is an example:

.. code-block::

    uart:~$ matter config
    VendorId:        65521 (0xFFF1)
    ProductId:       32772 (0x8004)
    HardwareVersion: 0 (0x0)
    PinCode:         20202021
    Discriminator:   f00
    Done


Matter light control demo
*************************

Start `chip-tool` in interactive mode by the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    chip-tool interactive start

Interactive mode is enabled to call multiple commands without timeouts.

Commission Matter devices
=========================

Flash the light bulb device and commission that to Thread network and use endpoint ``node_id`` 1:

.. code-block:: console

    pairing ble-thread 1 hex:35060004001fffe00c0402a0f7f8051000112233445566778899aabbccddee00030e4f70656e54687265616444656d6f0410445f2b5ca6f2a93a55ce570a70efeecb000300001a02081111111122222222010212340708fd110022000000000e0800000003601c0000 20202021 3840

Flash the light switch device and commission that to Thread network and use endpoint ``node_id`` 2:

.. code-block:: console

    pairing ble-thread 2 hex:35060004001fffe00c0402a0f7f8051000112233445566778899aabbccddee00030e4f70656e54687265616444656d6f0410445f2b5ca6f2a93a55ce570a70efeecb000300001a02081111111122222222010212340708fd110022000000000e0800000003601c0000 20202021 3840


Bind the light switch to the light bulb
=======================================

Update Light bulb's access list to include the light switch by the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    accesscontrol write acl '[{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 5, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [112233], "targets": null}, {"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 3, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [2], "targets": [{"cluster": 6, "endpoint": 1, "deviceType": null}, {"cluster": 8, "endpoint": 1, "deviceType": null}]}]' 1 0

Next, bind the light switch device to the light bulb device:

.. code-block:: console

    binding write binding '[{"fabricIndex": 1, "node": 1, "endpoint": 1, "cluster": 6}, {"fabricIndex": 1, "node": 1, "endpoint": 1, "cluster": 8}]' 2 1

Now the light switch device can control the light bulb device's led.

Light control
=============

The light switch sample supports three commands.

* Switch on: ``matter light on``
* Switch off:``matter light off``
* Toggle light state:``matter light toggle``

The ``chip-tool`` controller can be used too control a commissioned Matter light device.

.. code-block::

    onoff <command> <destination-id> <endpoint-id>

    `command` Light control command:
    * `on`: Switch On
    * `off`: Switch Off
    * `toggle`: Toggle Light state
    `destinatio-id` is device commisioned `node_id`.
    `endpoint-id` is 1.


Example for toggling ``node_id`` 1's light state:

.. code-block:: console

    onoff toggle 1 1
