	  LE audio presentation delay in ms. For the audio source use-case, this is defined as the
	  time in ms from the start of recording an audio frame, to the SDU reference anchor point
	  at which the SDU containing the same audio frame is sent over BLE. The absolute minimum
	  possible presentation delay would be the frame length (10 ms) plus the encoding time of
	  the frame, since it is impossible to send the frame before it has been fully recorded and
	  encoded. But some margin should be added on top of this to account for any overhead and
	  timing variations due to other activities of the software occurring while recording and
	  encoding the audio.
