AIPL Usage Examples Sample
##########################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates basic functionality of the Alif Image Processing Library. It includes such operations as:

* Cropping + Scaling
* Scaling + Rotating
* Cropping + Flipping
* Color format conversion
* Color correction
* White balance
* Gamma correction
* Exposure adjustment

Requirements
************

The sample utilizes the CDC200 IP from TES and the panel. The panel will display content generated by the CDC200. AIPL utilizes D/AVE2D GPU and uses Helium SIMD acceleration.

Supported Targets
*****************

* alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp
* alif_e7_dk_rtss_he

Building and Running
********************

To build the aipl-examples application:

.. code-block:: console

	west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp
