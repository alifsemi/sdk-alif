Below modifications are done on Soniclib library
to make it work on Alif boards:

- Compile out <invn/icu_interface/shasta_pmut_instruction.h>
  statement with INCLUDE_SHASTA_SUPPORT macro condition
  as not required for CH201 configuration.

- Compile out chdrv_adjust_rx_len() api signature with INCLUDE_SHASTA_SUPPORT
  macro condition as not required for CH201 configuration.

- Unused SonicLib components and folders not required for CH201
  operation were removed to reduce memory footprint and simplify
  integration.

- chirp_board_config.h is derived from invn/soniclib/details/chirp_board_config.h and
  it includes board-specific changes to the macro definitions.

- Modified below ascii characters in invn/soniclib/ch_math_utils.c:
  a. inverted to dash
  b. power of 2 to square
