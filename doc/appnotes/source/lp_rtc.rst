Introduction
============

This document explains how to create, compile, and run a demo application for the Low Power Real-Time Counter (LPRTC) driver IP provided by Synopsys and integrated into Alif Semiconductor Ensemble™ devices. The demo application uses the LPRTC module to generate interrupts at user-specified intervals, demonstrated through an alarm application.

Furthermore, the LPRTC is integrated into the Alarm application as a demo application, where it functions as expected. The same demo app is also utilized by the RTC (Real-Time Clock) and LPTIMER. To facilitate configuration, separate overlay and config files for the RTC, UTIMER, and LPTIMER reside in the board’s directory of the Alarm application. Users can select these files using the west build command.

Overview
--------

The LPRTC module is a configurable high-range binary counter that can generate an interrupt on a user-specified interval. Key features include:

- Located in the PD-0 power domain, enabling operation in the lowest power state with VDD_BATT power present.
- 32-bit counter width.
- Supports Wrap mode (wraps to zero on reaching the user-specified interval).
- Includes a 16-bit programmable prescaler to adjust timing.
- Tested with a sample alarm application detailed in this document.

Building LPRTC Application in Zephyr
=====================================

The LPRTC is integrated into the alarm application as a demonstration, shared with the LPTIMER and Utimer modules. Separate overlay and config files for LPRTC, LPTIMER, and Utimer are located in the board's directory within the alarm application. Users can select these files using the west build command.

Follow these steps to build the LPRTC alarm application using the GCC compiler and the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

2. Remove the existing build directory and build the application:

.. note::
   The build commands shown here are specifically for the Alif E7 DevKit.
   To build the application for other boards, modify the board name in the build command accordingly. For more information, refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_, under the section Setting Up and Building Zephyr Applications.

3. Build commands for applications on the M55 HP core using the Ninja build command:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf build
   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp samples/drivers/counter/alarm/ -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=samples/drivers/counter/alarm/boards/alif_rtc.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=samples/drivers/counter/alarm/boards/alif_rtc.overlay

4. Build commands for applications on the M55 HE core using the Ninja build command:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf build
   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_he samples/drivers/counter/alarm/ -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=samples/drivers/counter/alarm/boards/alif_rtc.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=samples/drivers/counter/alarm/boards/alif_rtc.overlay


Once the build command completes successfully, executable images will be generated and placed in the `build/zephyr` directory. Both `.bin` (binary) and `.elf` (Executable and Linkable Format) files will be available.

Executing Binary on the DevKit
==============================

To execute binaries on the DevKit follow the command

.. code-block:: bash

   west flash

Loading Binaries with SE Tools
==============================

For detailed instructions on loading executables using SE Tools, refer to the *Getting Started with ZAS for Ensemble* documentation.

Expected Result
===============

The sample alarm application will run continuously until manually stopped, generating interrupts at the user-specified interval based on the LPRTC configuration. The console output will display as follows:
