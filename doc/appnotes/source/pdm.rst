Introduction
============

This document explains how to create, compile, and run a demo application for the Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) controller IP provided by Alif Semiconductor" and integrated into Ensemble" devices. Key features include:

- A PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) microphone produces 1-bit digital data streams in Pulse Density Modulated format.
- The PDM Audio module supports eight audio channels, with each channel connecting to one microphone.
- PDM Audio converts each 1-bit PDM audio input into 16-bit PCM (Pulse Code Modulated) format.
- The host reads the 16-bit PCM data for each microphone through a set of APB registers.

Software Requirements
=====================

Below is a list of required software and drivers needed to run the PDM and LPPDM applications:

- **Alif Zephyr PDM driver**

Building the PDM Application
============================

Follow these steps to build your Zephyr-based PDM application using the GCC compiler and the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

2. Remove the existing build directory and build the application:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf build
   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp ../alif/samples/drivers/audio/dmic_alif/

Building the LPPDM Application
==============================

Both PDM and LPPDM use similar applications. To build the LPPDM application, modify the PDM sample application code from `DT_NODELABEL(pdm)` to `DT_NODELABEL(lppdm)`.

.. note::
   The application is designed for the Alif Ensemble E7 DevKit. Modify the sample code as needed for other DevKits.

.. code-block:: bash

   const struct device *pcmj_device = DEVICE_DT_NODELABEL(lppdm)

Follow these steps to build your Zephyr-based LPPDM application using the GCC compiler and the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. Fetch the Alif Zephyr SDK source at the desired revision:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir sdk-alif
   cd sdk-alif
   west init -m https://github.com/alifsemi/sdk-alif.git --mr ${revision}
   west update

.. note::
   Replace ``${revision}`` with any SDK revision (branch/tag/commit SHA) you wish to achieve.
   This can be ``main`` if you want the latest state, or any commit SHA or tag (e.g., ``west init -m https://github.com/alifsemi/sdk-alif.git --mr v1.2.0``).

2. Navigate to the Zephyr directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd zephyr

3. Remove the existing build directory and build the application:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf build
   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp ../alif/samples/drivers/audio/dmic_alif/

Executing Binary on the DevKit
==============================

To execute binaries on the DevKit, follow these steps:

.. figure:: _static/test_multiple_channels_pdm.png
      :alt: Selecting Multiple Channels in Test Application
      :align: center

      Selecting Multiple Channels in Test Application

2. Specify the block size to store the PCM data.

.. code-block:: bash

   #define PCMJ BlockSize >> >>   50000

3. Specify the number of samples to store the captured PCM data.

.. code-block:: bash

    /* Number of blocks in the slab */
   #define MEM_SLAB_NUM_BLOCKS >> >>   1


- If `PCMJ_BLOCK_SIZE` is 50000 and `MEM_SLAB_NUM_BLOCKS` is 1, 50000 PCM samples can be stored in the `pcmj_data` buffer.

- If `PCMJ_BLOCK_SIZE` is 50000 and `MEM_SLAB_NUM_BLOCKS` is 2, 100000 PCM samples can be stored in the `pcmj_data` buffer.

4. Choose the mode of operation in the `pdm_mode` API.

5. Set the FIFO watermark value in the DTS file.

6. Store the channel status configuration values for each channel.

7. Build the project and flash the generated `.elf` file onto the target.

8. Once all hardware connections are completed, power on the DevKit.

9. Start playing audio or speak near the PDM microphone on the DevKit.

10. When the sample count reaches the maximum value, the IRQ will be disabled, and audio capture will stop.

11. Stop the application code.

12. The PCM samples will be stored in the `pcmj_data` buffer. Print the base address of the `pcmj_data` buffer.

    The screenshot below shows channels 4 and 5 enabled, with the buffer address at `0x20000c3c`. 50,000 PCM samples are stored in the `pcmj_data` buffer, and the stored PCM samples are being printed.

    .. figure:: _static/pdm_buffer_samples.png
       :alt: PCM Samples Buffer
       :align: center

       PCM Samples Buffer (Channels 4 and 5, Address 0x20000c3c)

13. Copy the buffer address for channels 4 and 5.

14. Open the memory section, paste the buffer address, and press Enter.

15. In the buffer memory section, view the converted PCM samples stored in the buffer.

    The screenshot below shows the PCM samples stored at the specified buffer address.

    .. figure:: _static/pdm_memory_section.png
       :alt: PCM Samples in Memory Section
       :align: center

       PCM Samples in Memory Section

16. To export the memory:
    - Go to the right-most corner.
    - Click on the **View** menu.
    - Select the **Export Memory** option.

    .. figure:: _static/pdm_memory_export.png
       :alt: Export Memory Option
       :align: center

       Export Memory Option

17. By default, the start and end address will be present in the memory bounds.

18. Specify the length in bytes, corresponding to the buffer size.
    For example, if the number of samples is 50,000, the length in bytes will be 50,000 bytes.

19. Store the PCM samples in binary format with the filename `memory.bin`.

    .. figure:: _static/storing_pcm_samples.png
       :alt: Storing PCM Samples
       :align: center

       Storing PCM Samples


20. To play the PCM data, use the `pcmplay.c` file, which includes resources such as the `memory.bin` file, channel number, data types of the memory buffer, sampling rate, frequency, and generates the `pcm_samples.pcm` audio file.

21. Compile the `pcmplay.c` file using `gcc` to generate the `pcm_samples.pcm` file in the same directory.

22. Use the `ffplay` command to play the audio:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ffplay -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 8k pcm_samples.pcm

    Where:
    - `s16le`: 16-bit little-endian system.
    - `-ac`: Specifies the number of channels.
    - `-ar`: Specifies the frequency.

23. After entering the command, press Enter and connect the microphone to the NUC. The user will hear recorded audio (approximately 3-4 seconds) using any speaker.
For better quality, use earphones.

    .. figure:: _static/playing_audio_pdm.png
       :alt: Playing Audio
       :align: center

       Playing Audio

24. For LPPDM, follow the same procedure, selecting channels 0 and 1 instead of channels 4 and 5.

25. Select the mode of operation in the `pdm_mode` API.

26. Store the channel status configuration values for channels 0 and 1.

27. Build the project and flash the generated `.elf` file onto the target.

28. Follow the same PDM procedure to obtain PCM samples for LPPDM and play the recorded audio using the `ffplay` command.

Alternative Method Using Audacity Player
========================================

An alternative to `ffplay` is to use the Audacity player. Download and install Audacity, then follow these steps:

1. Go to **File** -> **Import** -> **Raw Data** and load the `memory.bin` file.

    .. figure:: _static/using_audacity_player.png
       :alt: Using Audacity Player
       :align: center

       Using Audacity Player


2. Select 16-bit PCM with little-endian byte order.

3. Specify the number of channels used by your application (e.g., 2 channels for the sample application; select 4 channels if using 4 channels).

4. Set the sample rate according to the PDM mode used in your application:

   - For standard voice with a baseband sampling rate of 8 kHz, use 8000.

   - For high-quality voice with a 512 PDM clock frequency, use 16000.
