Introduction
============

This application note describes how to flush continuous video frames to a serial display using the CDC200 device and an LCD panel. The ILI9806E panel is used for the demo application. The components in the display pipeline for Alif SoCs are:

1. CDC200 DPI-Display Controller
2. MIPI DSI Controller (with integrated DPLL/DPHY)
3. Display Panel

The MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) facilitates communication and data transfer from a processor to a DSI-compliant display panel. The interface is based on a DSI host controller, which implements the protocol functions defined in the MIPI DSI specification, while a D-PHY module acts as the physical layer. The Configurable DPI controller (CDC200) within the processor generates a video stream for the DSI controller to use. The CDC200 IP reads images (layers) from memory, combines them on the fly (e.g., by blending, cropping, and windowing operations), and generates a video output stream of the combined image. The CDC200 has two output interfaces:

1. Parallel Display Interface contains VSync, HSync, Pixel clk, DE signals, and 24 bitsGND for RGB channels.
2. Serial Display Interface connects internally to the MIPI DSI controller IP module to convert the RGB signals.

The Display Panel can be either parallel or serial. The serial display panel connects to the MIPI DSI controller IP, which is in turn connected to the CDC200.

CDC200 Blending Pipeline
========================

The CDC200 has two layers and a background layer color that are different parameters that can be controlled in a display system.

.. figure:: _static/cdc200_blending_pipeline.png

   CDC200 Blending Pipeline

The CDC (Color Display Controller) includes blending logic that combines the color values (RGB) of one layer with the blended results of sub-adjacent layers. Here's how it works:

1. **Blending Process**
   - To calculate a blended pixel, as many steps as there are layers are needed.
   - Internally, this process is achieved through the Alpha Blending Pipeline (ABP).
   - The ABP delivers one pixel per clock cycle.
   - The length of the ABP corresponds to the number of blending steps required (i.e., the number of layers).

2. **Layer Blending Order**
   - If two layers are enabled:

     - First, layer 1 is blended with the background (BG) color.

     - Then, layer 2 is blended with the result of the blended color from layer 1 and the background.

   .. math::
      C' = f_1 \cdot c + f_2 \cdot c_s

   - :math:`C'` = blended color
   - :math:`f_1` = blend factor for current layer pixels
   - :math:`c` = current layer color
   - :math:`f_2` = blend factor for sub-adjacent color
   - :math:`c_s` = sub-adjacent layer color

   .. list-table:: Possible Values of :math:`f_1`
      :widths: 20 50
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Value
        - Significance
      * - 4
        - Constant-:math:`\alpha`
      * - 6
        - Pixel-:math:`\alpha` * Constant-:math:`\alpha`

   .. list-table:: Possible Values of :math:`f_2`
      :widths: 20 50
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Value
        - Significance

        - 1 - Constant-:math:`\alpha`
      * - 6
        - 1 - (Pixel-:math:`\alpha` * Constant-:math:`\alpha`)

   Constant-:math:`\alpha` for each layer can be configured using the ``CDC_Ln_CONST_ALPHA`` register or the ``const-alpha-l1/2`` parameter in the driver. The pixel alpha (Pixel-:math:`\alpha`) is determined by the pixel format used for the layer. In ARGB formats, there is a per-pixel alpha value provided, whereas in non-ARGB formats, the per-pixel values are elaborated to ARGB values, with an:math:`\alpha` value of 0 per pixel.

   Alpha (:math:`\alpha`) represents the opacity of a layer. The alpha value for a layer can range from 0 to 255 (0xff). For example, in the blending scenario described above:

   1. Consider the following settings:
      - Global background color (bg-color): 0x00ff00 (Green)
      - Layer 2: Disabled
      - Layer 1: Disabled
      - Default layer color for layer 1 (def-layer-color): 0xffff0000 (Red)
      - Blending factors for layer 1 (f1, f2): (4, 5)
      - Blending factors for layer 2 (f1, f2): (6, 7)

   2. If the constant alpha (const(:math:`\alpha`) for layer 1 is set to 0xff (255), only the color from the current layer will be used during blending. Any alpha value associated with the pixel will be ignored. In this case, the resulting color will be 0xffff0000 (Red).

   3. Similarly, if the constant alpha for the background layer (const-:math:`\alpha`) is set to 0xff (255), only the color from the background layer will be used during blending. The resulting color will be 0x00ff00 (Green).

Hardware Requirements
=====================

CDC200 Controller
-----------------

The Customizable Display Controller (CDC) from TES is a fully configurable VHDL IP to drive pixel displays. It supports the following main features:

- Configurable resolution and refresh rate
- 2 display layers
- Programmable background color
- Color Look-up Table (CLUT) with 256 x 24 entries per layer for indexed pixel formats
- Flexible blending between the layers using alpha value (const alpha or Pixel alpha)
- Color Keying: defining transparent color for pixel formats without alpha channel
- Windowing: blending a programmable rectangular area of one layer into the other
- Default Color Programmable: per layer default color that is to be used in case of windowing or disabled layer
- Gamma Correction: map incoming RGB to different RGB values
- Dithering (2 bits per color Component): providing softer color transitions for displays with less color depth
- Multiple input pixel formats selectable per layer:
  - ARGB8888, RGBA8888, RGB888, RGB565, ARGB1555, ARGB4444
  - AL44, L8

Focus LCDs Panel Specifications
-------------------------------

Two example displays have been brought up on Alif Development Kit hardware. There is a 5" non-touch panel and a 4.3" capacitive touch panel included with the development kit depending on availability. They share the ILI9806E TFT controller, for which a driver is provided. To support additional displays using this same controller, simply change the resolution, timing values, and register sequence in the driver example.

.. note::
   For serial display: 2-lane display ILI9806E support is available only on the Alif Ensemble E7 DevKit.

Hardware Connection & Setup
===========================

The Alif DevKit connects to the ILI9806E panel via the MIPI DSI interface. The MIPI DSI controller on the DevKit Board interfaces with the ILI9806E panel using differential signaling pairs (D0P/N, D1P/N, CLKP/N) for high-speed data transmission. No external jumper wires are required, as the connections are internal to the board's MIPI DSI connector.

Building the CDC200 Application
===============================

The application was tested for the HP core. Follow these steps to build your Zephyr-based CDC200 application using the GCC compiler and the Alif Zephyr SDK:

.. note::
   The application is designed for the Alif Ensemble E7 DevKit. Modify the sample code as needed for other DevKits.

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

2. Remove the existing build directory and build the CDC200 application for TCM memory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      rm -rf build
      west build -b alif_e1c_dk_rtss_he ../alif/samples/drivers/display/ -- -G"Unix Makefiles" -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=$PWD/../alif/samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="/home/$USER/zas-1.3/zephyr/../alif/samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display_2lane.overlay"

3. To verify the application with OSPI memory, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      rm -rf build
      west build -b alif_e1c_dk_rtss_he ../alif/samples/drivers/display/ -- -G"Unix Makefiles" -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=$PWD/../alif/samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="/home/$USER/zas-1.3/zephyr/../alif/samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display_2lane.overlay"

   .. note::
      Since the serial display driver has its own overlay file, include its path along with the OSPI overlay file path.

4. Access the output and binary files: The binary file is available in the ``./build/zephyr/`` directory.

Required Config Features
========================

The following config features are necessary to test the application:

- ``CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=81920``
- ``CONFIG_LOG=y``
- ``CONFIG_DISPLAY=y``
- ``CONFIG_MIPI_DSI=y``
- ``CONFIG_DISPLAY_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y`` (to enable display driver debug logs)

These config features are already selected when building the test application.

Known Issues
============

- **Zephyr CDC200 Driver**: The Zephyr device driver for the CDC200 currently supports only ARGB8888, RGB888, and RGB565 formats. This is a limitation of the Zephyr framework and may be addressed in future releases.

- **Demo Application (Layer 2)**: In the demo application, Layer 2 is designed to copy an image in ARGB8888 format directly from a C array to the framebuffer. Therefore, avoid using any format other than ARGB8888 for Layer 2. Layer 1 formats can be changed without issue.
