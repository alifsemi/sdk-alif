Zephyr Version
--------------

This SDK includes a specific version of Zephyr RTOS with Alif Semiconductor device support.

The bundled Zephyr version contains Alif-specific board definitions, drivers, and sample applications.
Alif hardware support is not available in upstream Zephyr. We are working to upstream these contributions over time.

Use the Zephyr version included in this SDK to work with Alif hardware.
